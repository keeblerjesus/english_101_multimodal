		It is important to hear what each candidate thinks and feels in their own words, using their own voices. Often pull quotes are used to make an emotional appeal in journalism. This tactic is effective because people make a lot of their choices with a "gut feeling". This page will not have comparisons to historical figures or data. Simply, this page will contain the candidates own words.

	      <br>"We're gonna have to seal up those borders ... We're like a garbage can for the world ... On day one I will launch the largest deportation program in American history, gonna get the criminals out."
	      <br> it is worth mentioning that this isn't an isolated instance of President Trump slipping up one or two times. This audio file is a synthesis of a few speeches. He has shared this mode of thought regarding immigrants many times.

	      <br>"Politicians have got to stop treating immigration as an issue to scare up votes in an election, and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is: that we must finally come together to solve. I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the Border Security Bill that Donald Trump killed. When I was Attorney General of a border state I saw the chaos and violence caused by transnational criminal organizations that I took on. And when I am president we will: quickly remove those who arrive here unlawfully, prosecute the cartels, and give Border Patrol the support they so desperately need. At the same time, we must acknowledge we are a nation of immigrants. And I will work with Congress to pass immigration reform, including an earned path to citizenship for hardworking immigrants like farmworkers and our Dreamers."
	      <br>Noteworthy information is that this was not always Vice President Harris's immigration stance.
