	      	<br>Both candidates have positives and negatives within their personalities, strategies, and suggested policies. Some of the positives make a candidate good for office. Some of them are not relevant to the office. Some of the negatives are incidental or not relevant to politics. Some of the negatives would make a candidate unfit for office.

		<br>President Donald Trump is an amazing storyteller and he can excite a crowd. He has immigrants in his direct and immediate family. His family wouldn't be on United States soil without loose immigration policy. His words and policy suggestions are harsh and harm both immigrants and naturalized citizens alike regardless of whether or not he ultimately becomes President again.
		<br>
		<br>Vice President Kamala Harris is a true statesperson who can speak with composure and grace. Despite criticism of her policy suggestions not being progressive enough from voters further to the left than her, she does not exaggerate claims nor denigrate human beings and families in order to further her political career.
		<br>
		<br>The data and historical context support Vice President Harris’s pro-immigration stance. Sadly, the same cannot be said for President Trump.
