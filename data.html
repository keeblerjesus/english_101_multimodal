		<br>“They’re pouring into our country.” — President Donald Trump, Dec. 16, 2023, New Hampshire rally
		<br>This quote is one among many that can be shown to be untrue to varying degrees. As with many of the topics you will see in this set of data, there is a mismatch between the reality we all actually live in as measured by statistics and the reality that exists within the rhetoric of President Donald Trump.

		<br><i>"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists."</i> --President Donald Trump
		<br>“The Democrats say, ‘Please don’t call them animals. They’re humans.’ I said, ‘No, they’re not humans, they’re not humans, they’re animals’ … Nancy Pelosi told me that. She said, ‘Please don’t use the word animals when you’re talking about these people.’ I said, ‘I’ll use the word animal because that’s what they are.’” — April 2, 2024, Grand Rapids, Michigan, campaign event.

		<br>Perhaps the most notorious quote from President Trump was during the Philadelphia Candidate Debate wherein Trump alleges that immigrants were problematic in Springfield, OH. Naturally, nothing was ever substantiated in the affirmative. Notably, all that had occurred is that some random person had made an image with the allegations without citation and it exploded through Right Wing social media and then through Right Wing journalism, and finally it was popularized by is VP pick, JD Vance. All the evidence is to the contrary, including the mayor of Springfield providing a heartfelt account on how positive an effect the Haitian community has been on his town. Linked below is the Springfield Mayor's official response to these allegations.
